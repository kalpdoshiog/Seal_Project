## üõ†Ô∏è Method Used

**Primary**: PyMuPDF (fitz)
- Fast and reliable extraction engine
- 12 parallel workers for concurrent processing
- Table extraction enabled (367 tables found)
- Text cleaning and validation applied
- Minimum quality thresholds: 1,000 characters or 500 words
- UTF-8 encoding throughout

**Success Rate**: 99.8% (12,108 / 12,130)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed Extractions

**22 files failed** with reason: `low_quality_no_ocr`
- These PDFs had extractable text but didn't meet quality thresholds
- Text extracted was <1,000 characters AND <500 words
- OCR was disabled to prioritize speed
- These represent papers with primarily images/figures or poor PDF quality

## üöÄ Ready for Step 3

With text extraction essentially complete (99.8%), we can now proceed to:

1. ‚úÖ **Generate semantic embeddings** using sentence transformers
2. ‚úÖ **Build vector search index** with FAISS or similar
3. ‚úÖ **Implement RAG retrieval system** for paper search
4. ‚úÖ **Add summarization & Q&A** using LLMs

**Next Step**: `step3_embeddings/` - Create vector embeddings of all 12,108 papers for semantic search
